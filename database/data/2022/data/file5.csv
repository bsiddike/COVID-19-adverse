The subject's concurrent medical history included pregnancy at advanced maternal age and BMI increased.  The subject's concomitant medication included calcium gummies and Vita Med MD Redichew RX ((6s)-5-methyltetrahydrofolate glucosamine, colecalciferol, folic acid, mecobalamin, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin), both used as supplement.  The subject's obstetrical history included no previous pregnancies. The subject had no history of offspring with major congenital malformations (MCMs) and no relevant maternal or paternal medical history with MCM. The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.  The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 22-Dec-2019. The estimated delivery date (EDD) and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 27-Sep-2020. The type of pregnancy was singleton.  On 18-Mar-2020, at gestational age of 12 weeks (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration, anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for an influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100126099 (the expiry date was not reported).  On an unknown date in 2020, unknown amount of time after vaccination, the subject developed uterine leiomyoma and endometriosis of pelvis.  On 04-Mar-2020 and 15-Apr-2020, the ultrasound scan revealed no MCMS.   On 12-May-2020, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening (MSAFP) / serum markers revealed no MCM.  On 09-Sep-2020, at gestational age of 37.4 week (as reported), the subject delivered live birth, female neonate via caesarean method of delivery. The neonate's birth weight was 2807 grams, head circumference was 33 cm, and body length were 48,9 cm. The appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respiration (APGAR) score at one minute was 8, at five minutes was 9 and at 10 minutes was not provided. There was no MCM noted at birth. On the same day, the subject experienced post-delivery haemorrhage.  On the same day, the subject recovered from the event 'hemorrhage postpartum'.

Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of Bilateral Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), in a female patient aged 54-year-old, who was vaccinated with Unspecified Shingles vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis.   The patient was a right-handed dominant female chef at a local university. No information on patient medical or family history or concurrent condition or concomitant medication was reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient had received unspecified Shingles vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age at vaccination was not reported but it could be between 53 and 54 years.   On an unknown date, a few days after receiving vaccination, the patient developed right upper extremity (RUE) pain which was quickly followed by RUE weakness. The patient saw an outside neurologist at that time, and after an extensive workup that included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction studies (NCS), and lumbar puncture (LP), no organic cause was discovered, and based on patient clinical examination a functional disorder was suspected (giveway/collapsing weakness). Five months later, a similar series of symptoms occurred in the left upper extremity (pain followed by weakness). No further workup was done at that time, and the patient did not receive treatment due to the belief that her symptoms were psychogenic. Despite spontaneous resolution of pain, the patient presented to the emergency room for persistent weakness four months later (nine months after the initial event involving the RUE). On physical examination during her most recent admission, profound symmetric weakness was noted in her bilateral upper extremities. The weakness was more severe proximally (2/5 strength in deltoids; 3/5 biceps, triceps, wrist extensors, wrist flexors, and intrinsic hand muscles; 4/5 finger flexors and extensors), and significant atrophy of the bilateral shoulders was noted. The patient upper extremity reflexes (biceps, triceps, brachioradialis) were absent bilaterally, with preservation of her lower extremity reflexes. Sensation to pinprick, light touch, vibration, and temperature were diminished symmetrically up to the shoulder in her bilateral upper extremities. During the patient most recent/final admission, the patient received an evaluation that included MRI with gadolinium of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and brachial plexus, along with Lumbar puncture (LP).

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and LP revealed no contributory findings to her clinical symptoms. EMG of her bilateral upper extremities revealed evidence of an active denervating process involving C5 through T1 distribution in both upper extremities. No genetic testing was done, but the patient denied any family history of similar symptoms.  The case was considered as serious due to hospitalization.  Treatment included intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and prednisone. The patient was also referred to physical therapy.  Outcome of the event was of reported.  The authors commented ""It is our belief that PTS was triggered in our patient secondary to the vaccine she received, though it is rarely possible to pinpoint a definite etiology. Many associations with PTS have been documented including infection, surgery, anesthesia, rheumatic disease, trauma, stressful exercise, pregnancy, radiation therapy, and vaccination. Given the lack of family history, our suspicion of hereditary PTS was low, though we cannot rule it out as a contributing factor as no genetic testing was done. In the case of this particular patient, her first EMG was done too early to be of diagnostic value for her, as significant abnormalities often do not appear until three weeks after onset in PTS. In most cases, the differential is broad and the history (especially time of onset) may not always be clear, so delaying EMG testing is not always reasonable. As suggested by this case, threshold for a repeat EMG in patients with persistent, recurrent, or worsening symptoms without a diagnosis should be low. In our patient, 38 weeks passed before the diagnosis was established, which was well beyond the suggested therapeutic window for prednisone mentioned above. This is actually shorter than the mean time of 43.8 weeks for diagnosis according to one review, although the median was significantly shorter at 10.5 weeks. We treated this patient with IVIG and prednisone. There is no strong evidence as to how a patient with PTS should be treated in the chronic phase, but there is reported efficacy in case reports from the use of IVIG both as monotherapy and in combination with prednisone. In the acute phase, the pain is often so intense that it is necessary to treat with opiates, tricyclics, or anti-epileptic drugs. In the case of this patient, the pain had already resolved spontaneously, so there was no indication for pain management. We also referred this patient to physical therapy, which is utilized for both range of motion and strengthening. Caution must be used in early reinnervation stages, as overloading injured muscles can retard axonal regeneration and muscle reinnervation. Limited EMG follow-up testing may be utilized to demonstrate the extent of reinnervation and guide advancement of strengthening regimen, but is not absolutely necessary. Although the diagnosis of PTS was significantly delayed in this patient, this does not necessarily mean that the suspicion of a functional disorder was incorrect. Functional disorders may be diagnosed based on positive findings, such as Hoover's sign, drift without pronation, give way weakness, and so on, and are not always a diagnosis of exclusion. With this in mind, it is important to consider that a patient may display these positive findings as part of a functional overlay to an organic neurologic disorder"".  The authors concluded ""In a patient presenting with shoulder pain followed by weakness, PTS should always be included in the differential diagnosis, especially if the initial workup does not reveal an obvious etiology. PTS is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and EMG findings are often unrevealing in the acute phase (up to three weeks). A functional disorder, even when correctly diagnosed secondary to positive findings as mentioned in the discussion, does not exclude an underlying organic neurologic disorder. In some cases, an organic neurologic disorder may even be considered a risk factor for a functional disorder. Current treatment options for PTS are limited, but there is evidence that oral prednisone within the first month may be beneficial, so a timely diagnosis is of increased importance. Given that EMG findings may not be apparent until three weeks after symptom onset, the threshold for ordering a repeat EMG should be low in patients without a strong diagnosis"".",,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,"Test Name: CSF glucose; Test Result:  66 mg/dl; Test Name: CSF lymphocytes; Test Result:  98 %; Test Name: CSF monocyte count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:2 differential based on: 100 cells,Unit:%); Test Name: CSF protein; Test Result:  23.0 mg/dl; Test Name: CSF red blood cell; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:1,Unit:/mcL); Test Name: CSF white blood cell; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:4,Unit:/mcL); Test Name: electromyography; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:no organic cause was discovered,Unit:unknown); Test Name: electromyography; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: electromyography; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:denervating process involving C5 through T1 distri,Unit:unknown); Test Name: magnetic resonance imaging; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:no organic cause was discovered,Unit:unknown); Test Name: magnetic resonance imaging; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: magnetic resonance imaging; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:no contributory findings to her clinical symptoms.,Unit:unknown); Test Name: nerve conduction studies; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:no organic cause was discovered,Unit:unknown); Test Name: nerve conduction studies; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:no contributory findings to her clinical symptoms,Unit:unknown); Test Name: physical examination; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:See text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: PCR; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Comments: On an unspecified date lab test were performed.

A 16-year-old female patient received the first dose of meningococcal group b rlp2086 (TRUMENBA) strength: 0.5 ml, lot no: CM1497, expiration date: 30Jun2022, via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid on 26Mar2020 12:02 at 0.5 mL, single for immunization. The patient's medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included meningococcal vaccine a/c/y/w conj (dip tox) (MENACTRA) lot no: U6575AA, expiration date: 08May2021, and diphtheria vaccine toxoid, pertussis vaccine acellular, tetanus vaccine toxoid (TDAP) lot no: U6621BA, expiration date: 21Mar2022, both received on 26Mar2020 for immunization. The patient previously received TDAP and MENACTRA doses as it was reported that TDAP and Menactra vaccines had been administered before to the patient with no adverse reaction. The healthcare professional wanted to know if it is okay to give second dose of TRUMENBA if patient had an adverse reaction to it on 27Mar2020. The female patient was 16 years old at the time of events: rash on face, facial swelling, throat was tightening but no trouble breathing, and swollen lips. She said the patient also got 2 other vaccines administered at the same time, but the TRUMENBA was the only new vaccine. She stated that the doctor would like to know if it is recommended to give the second TRUMENBA vaccine, since the patient may have had a possible reaction to TRUMENBA. She added that after receiving the TRUMENBA vaccine, the patient had a rash on her face the following morning (27May2020) and tried cetirizine cetirizine (ZYRTEC). The rash got worse, with the patient experiencing facial swelling, and saying it felt like her throat was getting tight, but the patient's throat was not closing. The patient did not have any trouble breathing. The patient was given a steroid and an epinephrine (EPI-PEN) injection because the patient's lips were swollen, as well. No relevant tests done. The patient recovered from the events.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender's Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the events ""rash on face, facial swelling, throat was tightening but no trouble breathing, and swollen lips"" with TRUMENBA can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.",,,,,,,,,Y,03/26/2020,03/27/2020,1,,PVT,,MENACTRA; TDAP,,,,USPFIZER INC2020383252,2,10/08/2020,,,,

Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a 66-years-old female patient, who was vaccinated with unspecified seasonal influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to table 1 reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of the study which described the clinical and virological responses to oseltamivir and baloxavir treatment in five allogeneic SCT recipients, and molecular characteristics of the influenza virus population before and after treatment. [It was used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. Allogeneic SCT patients with influenza A virus infection who received oseltamivir with no resolution of symptoms and were persistently positive for influenza A virus by the FilmArray Respiratory Pathogen two panel were included in the study]. The patient had angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) in partial remission and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who received a matched related donor (MRD) stem cell transplant (SCT) (in October 2018). The patient received fludarabine, melphalan, alemtuzumab, and total body irradiation (TBI 400cGy) as conditioning and tacrolimus as post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Because of detectable circulating EBV DNA prior to transplant, the patient received one dose of rituximab with her transplant conditioning. The patient received Rituximab in prior 6 months. Time duration from SCT was 0.30 years. The patient had not active GVHD. The patient (setting) was from inpatient. No information on patient's family history was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received annual unspecified seasonal influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date in February 2019, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient experienced chills, rhinorrhea, cough, and fever to 39 degree Celsius and was diagnosed with influenza A H1 2009 (Influenza A virus type: H1N1) using the RP2 panel. Nasopharyngeal swab in universal viral transport media (BD) was collected as part of routine clinical care. The patient did not receive immunosuppressive therapy at the time of influenza diagnosis. Oseltamivir therapy was initiated (for 5 days), but 5 days later the patient presented to the emergency department with recurrent high fevers to 40 degree Celsius, chills, rhinorrhea, dry cough, and loose stool. CT chest showed left upper lobe pneumonia, and a repeat RP2 panel was still positive for influenza A virus. The infection type was pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for hypotension/sepsis and received broad-spectrum antibiotics and baloxavir 40 mg for influenza. The next day, a urinary antigen test for Legionella pneumophila serotype 1 was reported to be positive and antibiotic treatment with azithromycin 500 mg daily was started. The co-pathogen included Legionella. Her symptoms rapidly improved but the patient continued to complain of persistent cough and tiredness, and the RP2 panel was still positive for influenza A. A second dose of baloxavir 40 mg was administered 4 days after the initial dose, and the patient was discharged home two days later. When the patient returned to clinic for follow-up 1 and 3 weeks after discharge, her symptoms were much improved, the patient had no cough, but was positive for influenza A/H1pdm09 at both visits. The influenza outcome was persistent shedding. Neuraminidase sequence was WT (Wild-type) and Polymerase sequence was I38T. This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. On an unspecified date in July 2019, the patient died from progressive disease. It was unknown whether the patient's autopsy was performed or not. [Nasopharyngeal swabs in universal viral transport media (BD) were collected as part of routine clinical care using standard procedures. Influenza was detected using the RP2 panel. Nucleic acid was isolated both using an automated platform (easyMAG) and using QIAamp kit in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols. Nucleic acids extracted using the easyMAG platform were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR to confirm the presence of influenza virus. Nucleic acids extracted using QIAamp kits were sequenced with next-generation sequencing methods for whole-genome analysis. A total of five patients who were both symptomatic and persistently positive for influenza A on the RP2 panel after receiving oseltamivir were treated with baloxavir. Oseltamivir was administered at the standard dose of 75 mg twice/day orally. Baloxavir was administered orally as a single or two doses of 40 or 80 mg, based on weight, according to manufacturer's instructions. All patients were profoundly immunocompromised because of allogeneic lymphodepleting SCT. In addition, two had received rituximab (monoclonal antibody directed to the lymphocyte surface protein CD20) within 6 months of influenza diagnosis, two had received prolonged immunosuppressive treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and one was obese, a predisposing condition for severe influenza. All patients had coinfection with other pathogens, four of them had pneumonia and were hospitalized].  This case has been considered serious due to suspected vaccination failure, death and hospitalization. The author commented, ""It has been repeatedly reported that the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised hosts is problematic, requiring prolonged treatment courses, causing an increased risk of the development of antiviral-resistant influenza variants. Moreover, because uncomplicated influenza in this patient population may present with few initial symptoms and no fever, the diagnosis is often delayed, and treatment with NAI is often initiated after the preferred 48-hour window from onset of symptoms. Baloxavir has been recently approved for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza. It has been shown that treatment with baloxavir is associated with a more rapid viral clearance. Here, we describe the treatment of five allogeneic SCT recipients with baloxavir who were still positive for influenza A after oseltamivir treatment. In 4 of these subjects, including those with demonstrated oseltamivir-resistant variants, treatment with baloxavir was followed by clinical improvement and viral clearance. Three patients did not have any detectable NAI resistance-associated changes in the influenza viruses sequenced at the time they received baloxavir, and we cannot exclude the possibility that more prolonged oseltamivir treatment may have also been effective for symptom resolution and viral clearance. We found that one of the treated subjects developed a PA variant after two doses of baloxavir. Although the patient improved and eventually cleared the infection, the potential for transmission of variant virus raises concern. Despite the small patient number and the lack of a control group, our data suggest that baloxavir may be a useful treatment option for infections with influenza virus with NAI-resistant variants, and/or in SCT patients who fail NAI treatment for other reasons. Combination therapy, including baloxavir and oseltamivir, has shown synergistic activity in vitro. This treatment option might be more effective and may decrease the emergence of resistant influenza variants in the immunocompromised host."" The author concluded, ""Our data suggest that baloxavir treatment can be effective in treating neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza in profoundly immunocompromised patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to define the role of baloxavir alone and combined with oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in SCT recipients and other immunocompromised populations.""

The subject was treated with oseltamivir, azithromycin and baloxavir marboxil. On an unknown date, the outcome of the vaccination failure was unknown and the outcome of the pneumonia bacterial, lung congestion, enterovirus infection, h1n1 influenza, rhinovirus infection, cough, sputum discolored, fatigue aggravated, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection, exertional dyspnea and activities of daily living impaired were recovered/resolved.   It was unknown if the reporter considered the vaccination failure, pneumonia bacterial, lung congestion, enterovirus infection, h1n1 influenza, rhinovirus infection, cough, sputum discolored, fatigue aggravated, dyspnea, upper respiratory tract infection, exertional dyspnea and activities of daily living impaired to be related to Flu vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a 64-years-old male patient, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to table 1  reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of the study which described the clinical and virological responses to oseltamivir and baloxavir treatment in five allogeneic SCT recipients, and molecular characteristics of the influenza virus population before and after treatment. [It was used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. Allogeneic SCT patients with influenza A virus infection who received oseltamivir with no resolution of symptoms and were persistently positive for influenza A virus by the Respiratory Pathogen two panel were included in the study]. The patient had Richter's transformation of chronic lymphoid leukemia to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, for which the patient received a matched related donor (MRD) allogeneic SCT in January 2017. The patient was conditioned with fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab and received tacrolimus as post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The patient's post-transplant course was complicated by Epstein-Barr virus-mediated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) with lymph node, liver, and kidney involvement, for which the patient received several doses of rituximab (most recently in October 2018). The patient received Rituximab in prior 6 months. Time duration from SCT was 1.97 years. The patient had not active GVHD. The patient (setting) was from outpatient. No information on patient's family history was provided. On an unspecified date in October 2018, the patient received annual unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date at the end of December 2018, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient presented to the clinic complaining of severe cough with yellow sputum production. Nasopharyngeal swab in universal viral transport media was collected as part of routine clinical care. An RP2 panel was positive for influenza A/H1pdm09 (Influenza A virus type: H1N1) and rhinovirus/enterovirus. The co-pathogen included Rhinovirus/enterovirus. The patient did not receive immunosuppressive therapy at the time of influenza diagnosis. The infection type was upper respiratory infection (URI). The patient received oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza and azithromycin for possible associated bacterial pneumonia, both for 5 days with no improvement. A repeat RP2 panel was still positive for influenza A, and a second course of oseltamivir was administered for an additional five days. [The patient received oseltamivir for 20 days]. The patient was seen in clinic weekly for 3 additional weeks and continued to complain of persistent cough with yellow sputum, worsening fatigue with dyspnea on exertion. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. RP2 tests at each visit remained positive for influenza A. The patient therefore received one dose (80 mg, weight-based) of baloxavir (once). At the follow-up visit 5 days later, his symptoms had improved, and the patient was able to walk without experiencing any shortness of breath. At this time, influenza A was not detected. By the following visit two weeks later, cough, congestion, and shortness of breath had resolved, and the patient had resumed normal activity. The influenza outcome was clearance. Neuraminidase sequence was H275Y and Polymerase sequence was WT (Wild-type). This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown. [Nasopharyngeal swabs in universal viral transport media were collected as part of routine clinical care using standard procedures. Influenza was detected using the RP2 panel. Nucleic acid was isolated both using an automated platform  and using lavatory kit in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols. Nucleic acids extracted using the platform were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR to confirm the presence of influenza virus. Nucleic acids extracted using lavatory kits were sequenced with next-generation sequencing methods for whole-genome analysis. A total of five patients who were both symptomatic and persistently positive for influenza A on the RP2 panel after receiving oseltamivir were treated with baloxavir. Oseltamivir was administered at the standard dose of 75 mg twice/day orally. Baloxavir was administered orally as a single or two doses of 40 or 80 mg, based on weight, according to manufacturer's instructions. All patients were profoundly immunocompromised because of allogeneic lymphodepleting SCT. In addition, two had received rituximab (monoclonal antibody directed to the lymphocyte surface protein CD20) within 6 months of influenza diagnosis, two had received prolonged immunosuppressive treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and one was obese, a predisposing condition for severe influenza. All patients had coinfection with other pathogens, four of them had pneumonia and were hospitalized]. This case has been considered serious due to suspected vaccination failure. The author commented, ""It has been repeatedly reported that the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised hosts is problematic, requiring prolonged treatment courses, causing an increased risk of the development of antiviral-resistant influenza variants. Moreover, because uncomplicated influenza in this patient population may present with few initial symptoms and no fever, the diagnosis is often delayed, and treatment with NAI is often initiated after the preferred 48-hour window from onset of symptoms. Baloxavir has been recently approved by the Regulatory Authority  for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza. It has been shown that treatment with baloxavir is associated with a more rapid viral clearance. Here, we describe the treatment of five allogeneic SCT recipients with baloxavir who were still positive for influenza A after oseltamivir treatment. In 4 of these subjects, including those with demonstrated oseltamivir-resistant variants, treatment with baloxavir was followed by clinical improvement and viral clearance. Three patients did not have any detectable NAI resistance-associated changes in the influenza viruses sequenced at the time they received baloxavir, and we cannot exclude the possibility that more prolonged oseltamivir treatment may have also been effective for symptom resolution and viral clearance. We found that one of the treated subjects developed a PA variant after two doses of baloxavir. Although the patient improved and eventually cleared the infection, the potential for transmission of variant virus raises concern. Despite the small patient number and the lack of a control group, our data suggest that baloxavir may be a useful treatment option for infections with influenza virus with NAI-resistant variants, and/or in SCT patients who fail NAI treatment for other reasons. Combination therapy, including baloxavir and oseltamivir, has shown synergistic activity in vitro. This treatment option might be more effective and may decrease the emergence of resistant influenza variants in the immunocompromised host."" The author concluded, ""Our data suggest that baloxavir treatment can be effective in treating neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza in profoundly immunocompromised patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to define the role of baloxavir alone and combined with oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in SCT recipients and other immunocompromised populations.""

0890472,10/17/2020,SC,34.0,34,,F,,"I went to get a flu vaccine at my local pharmacy clinic. I asked for the flublok quadrivalent vaccine because I had read that it was better suited for people with allergies, and who are prone to have allergic reactions. However, the nurse practitioner insisted that I get the flucelvax quadrivalent flu vaccine instead. She told me that she and her children had received the same vaccine, and that they didn't have a bad reaction to it. She told me that both vaccines were very similar. I thought it was odd that she just didn't give me the vaccine I asked for, but I didn't see any reason to press the matter. So I agreed to have the flucelvac quadrivalent vaccine which she kept insisting on. After she administered the flu vaccine to me I left. I didn't live far from the store. I started to feel tingling all over my body about 30 to 45mins after I received the flu vaccine.  When this started happening I thought that I must be having a mild reaction to the vaccine. The tingling and itching lasted all day. I was still itching some the next day, but this time I noticed that my left hand, on the arm that I received the injection was really really sore, and weak. My left arm muscles also ached and felt really fatigued. The muscle ache in my left hand, and arm lasted all day. Later on that night my entire body was experiencing muscle aches, and muscle fatigue. When I went to bed that night I took a Benadryl and went  to sleep. The next day the itching I had experienced had greatly diminished, but I was still experiencing muscle aches and fatigue all over my body. I have to lift heavy things at work, and for the past few days it has been difficult to do  so because of the muscle fatigue I've been experiencing. I am writing a report today, 10/17/20, because it has been a week since I received the flu vaccine, and I am still experiencing mild itching, muscle aches, and muscle fatigue.

I immediately suggested that they call their PCP or go to an urgent care center in case it is an allergic reaction.  She asked if Benadryl was ok to give him. I stated that Benadryl would help if it's an allergic reaction but since he's having a lump feeling in his throat he may need something stronger.  The wife asked if this was common after the vaccine.  I checked facts and comparisons to see if there was information on this and explained to her that there is an oculorespiratory syndrome documented that begins within 2-24 hours after vaccine administration.

It was unknown if the reporter considered the unknown cause of death, vaccination failure, influenza a virus infection, coronavirus infection, pneumonia bacterial, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypoxic respiratory failure, shortness of breath, cough, fever, enterovirus infection, rhinovirus infection and fatigue to be related to Flu vaccine.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the suspected vaccination failure in a 61-years-old female patient, who was vaccinated with unspecified influenza vaccine (manufacturer unknown) for prophylaxis. This case corresponds to table 1 reported in this literature article. The patient was a part of the study which described the clinical and virological responses to oseltamivir and baloxavir treatment in five allogeneic SCT recipients, and molecular characteristics of the influenza virus population before and after treatment. [It was used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. Allogeneic SCT patients with influenza A virus infection who received oseltamivir with no resolution of symptoms and were persistently positive for influenza A virus by the FilmArray Respiratory Pathogen two panel were included in the study]. The patient had a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient underwent a matched related donor (MRD) stem cell transplant (SCT) in November 2016 conditioned with fludarabine, melphalan, and alemtuzumab and received tacrolimus as post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Time duration from SCT was 2.12 years. The patient had active GVHD. The patient (setting) was from inpatient. The patient's post-transplant course was complicated by cytogenetic disease relapse at 1 year. The patient received two donor lymphocyte infusions, which successfully controlled her malignancy but resulted in GVHD necessitating prolonged immunosuppression with systemic steroids, tacrolimus, and ruxolitinib. No information on patient's family history was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date in end of December 2018, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient was admitted to an outside hospital complaining of shortness of breath, cough, and fever to 39 degree Celsius for 2 days prior to admission. Nasopharyngeal swab in universal viral transport media (BD) was collected as part of routine clinical care. The patient was found to be positive for influenza A. Chest x-ray showed bilateral interstitial opacifications suggesting a possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The infection type was pneumonia. The patient required high flow oxygen and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The patient was treated with oseltamivir, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and steroids for possible acute respiratory distress syndrome. Blood cultures were negative. After 4 days, the patient was transferred to the hospital, and on admission, RP2 was positive for influenza A/H1pdm09 (Influenza A virus type: H1N1) and coronavirus 229E. The patient received immunosuppressive therapy at the time of influenza diagnosis included prednisone 20 mg once a day (QD)/Ruxolitinib 5 mg twice a day (BID), Tacrolimus. The patient did not receive Rituximab in prior 6 months. The co-pathogen included rhinovirus/enterovirus. Treatment with oseltamivir for 5 days and broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible bacterial superinfection was continued for 10 days of total course. Despite this treatment, the patient continued to experience profound fatigue, productive cough, and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring oxygen supplementation (2-4L). Chest computerized tomography (CT) performed 3 weeks after admission showed variable change in multilobar pneumonia with improvement within the left upper lobe and progression in the left lower lobe. Weekly RP2 panels during this period were positive for influenza A and coronavirus 229E. Because of the concern for oseltamivir-resistant influenza, the patient received baloxavir (80 mg), once. The patient's respiratory status, cough, and fatigue rapidly improved, and the patient was discharged home four days after baloxavir treatment. A RP2 panel performed at discharge was positive for influenza A/H1pdm09, but it was unable to detect the virus in the same specimen by real-time RT-PCR or next-generation sequencing. The patient missed follow-up appointments because of severe weather conditions and was readmitted for unrelated issues one month after discharge. At that time, the patient was asymptomatic and the RP2 panel was negative for influenza and still positive for coronavirus 229E. The influenza outcome was clearance. Neuraminidase sequence was H275Y and Polymerase sequence was WT (Wild-type). This case has been considered as suspected vaccination failure being the time to onset was unknown.  On an unspecified date in January 2020, the patient succumbed to fatal complications of GVHD. It was unknown whether the patient's autopsy was performed or not. [Nasopharyngeal swabs in universal viral transport media (BD) were collected as part of routine clinical care using standard procedures. Influenza was detected using the RP2 panel. Nucleic acid was isolated both using an automated platform (easyMAG) and using QIAamp kit in accordance with the manufacturers' protocols. Nucleic acids extracted using the easyMAG platform were tested by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR to confirm the presence of influenza virus. Nucleic acids extracted using QIAamp kits were sequenced with next-generation sequencing methods for whole-genome analysis. A total of five patients who were both symptomatic and persistently positive for influenza A on the RP2 panel after receiving oseltamivir were treated with baloxavir. Oseltamivir was administered at the standard dose of 75 mg twice/day orally. Baloxavir was administered orally as a single or two doses of 40 or 80 mg, based on weight, according to manufacturer's instructions. All patients were profoundly immunocompromised because of allogeneic lymphodepleting SCT. In addition, two had received rituximab (monoclonal antibody directed to the lymphocyte surface protein CD20) within 6 months of influenza diagnosis, two had received prolonged immunosuppressive treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and one was obese, a predisposing condition for severe influenza. All patients had coinfection with other pathogens, four of them had pneumonia and were hospitalized].  This case has been considered serious due to suspected vaccination failure, death and hospitalization. The author commented, ""It has been repeatedly reported that the treatment of influenza in immunocompromised hosts is problematic, requiring prolonged treatment courses, causing an increased risk of the development of antiviral-resistant influenza variants. Moreover, because uncomplicated influenza in this patient population may present with few initial symptoms and no fever, the diagnosis is often delayed, and treatment with NAI is often initiated after the preferred 48-hour window from onset of symptoms. Baloxavir has been recently approved for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza. It has been shown that treatment with baloxavir is associated with a more rapid viral clearance. Here, we describe the treatment of five allogeneic SCT recipients with baloxavir who were still positive for influenza A after oseltamivir treatment. In 4 of these subjects, including those with demonstrated oseltamivir-resistant variants, treatment with baloxavir was followed by clinical improvement and viral clearance. Three patients did not have any detectable NAI resistance-associated changes in the influenza viruses sequenced at the time they received baloxavir, and we cannot exclude the possibility that more prolonged oseltamivir treatment may have also been effective for symptom resolution and viral clearance. We found that one of the treated subjects developed a PA variant after two doses of baloxavir. Although the patient improved and eventually cleared the infection, the potential for transmission of variant virus raises concern. Despite the small patient number and the lack of a control group, our data suggest that baloxavir may be a useful treatment option for infections with influenza virus with NAI-resistant variants, and/or in SCT patients who fail NAI treatment for other reasons. Combination therapy, including baloxavir and oseltamivir, has shown synergistic activity in vitro. This treatment option might be more effective and may decrease the emergence of resistant influenza variants in the immunocompromised host.""

Pt states her temp was 103 ( TA ) this morning, and is currently 99.4.  States she is experiencing slight body aches, and a persistent frontal headache.  Rates headache 2/10 currently, but states ibuprofen is not helping.  Pt states her fingers and toes were feeling numb and tingling earlier, but that has ceased.  Denies weakness on one side of the body.  Denies blurred, or double vision.  Denies a rash, or vomiting.  States headache is interfering with her normal activities.  Denies difficulty breathing, or swallowing.  Denies chest pain, or fainting.  Denies swelling in back of throat, or tongue.  Denies palpitations.  Reviewed immunization, tetanus and headache, disposition seek medical care within 24 hours.  I advised pt to go to urgent care to be assessed.  Pt verbalizes understanding, but wants to speak with the on call provider.  I instructed pt to call back if no response from on call within 30 minutes.  Pt verbalizes understanding.   From MD Spoke to patient yesterday.  Already feeling better by time of call and temp around 99 degrees.  Taking Advil helps with chills and aches.  She has NO respiratory symptoms and Tmax of about 103 was transient (resolved without meds it seems).  I think very unlikely to be flu or COVID and given the timing of symptoms, most likely a vaccine reaction.  Will add Tdap to her chart and have office file a report.  She agreed to call back immediately with any worsening symptoms, fever that goes back up or if symptoms haven't resolved by Monday.  She's in agreement with plan.",,,,,,,,,U,10/15/2020,10/16/2020,1,N/A,PVT,,ortho tri-cycle BCP.; levothyroxine,N/A,MS,,,2,10/19/2020,,,,"Prior Tdap reaction, DKA"

0891051,10/20/2020,Ar,,,,F,,"Central nervous system demyelination; Information has been received from the authors of the published literature article, titled as stated below.  Since its inception, the polyvalent vaccine against the Quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV), HPV rL1 6 11 16 18 VLP vaccine (yeast), has generated some controversies as a temporal relationship between the administrations of the vaccine and the development of a few autoimmune diseases, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported. There are two cases whose initial presentation of central nervous system (CNS) demyelination followed in close time relationship the administration of Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL).  The patient in this report is the first case- a 19-year-old woman who received two doses of Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL), 3 months apart, and approximately 1 month after the second dose, she developed numbness to the right foot that within 1 day extended to the contralateral foot and was associated with mid-thoracic back  pain. Her neurological examination was only significant for the altered perception to touch to the feet. Deep tendon reflexes were normal and plantar reflexes in flexion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cervical and thoracic spine revealed a total of three lesions with characteristic demyelinating appearance, one of those in the thoracic spine was contrast-enhancing. MRI brain demonstrated one additional white matter lesion also consistent with a demyelinating process. Antinuclear antibody titers and serology for Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative; angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels, vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was never tested. The patient was treated in the acute setting with high doses of intravenous methylprednisolone and clinical improvement ensued. Demyelinating disease was felt to be the likely diagnosis and approximately 4 months later treatment with natalizumab was initiated. The patient has remained clinically asymptomatic afterwards but the repeated MRI brain at 1 year showed new lesions in the white matter of both hemispheres and a small contrast enhancing area in the right frontal lobe. The patient tested positive for anti-natalizumab antibodies and the medication was discontinued. Alternative therapy for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) has been instituted.   Since agency approval in June 2006, Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) has been implicated in the development of acute inflammatory polyneuropathy, MS and ADEM. It has been reported that 12 million doses of HPV vaccines have been distributed and 7802 adverse events were recorded. Of the 10 confirmed cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, five had received concurrent administration of meningococcal ACYW conj vaccine (dip toxoid) (MENACTRA).  The first case reported here was concerning for causality, as no medical problems were present prior to the administration of the vaccine and the criteria for the diagnosis of MS are met on follow-up MRI scan. In the second case, the development of sensory symptoms approximately 3 weeks before exposure to Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) poses the question of a pre-existing condition, unmasked by the trauma, reaching its full expression in coincidence with the vaccination.  Administration of Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) exacerbated the clinical course of three patients who had already manifested neurological symptoms consistent with clinically isolated syndrome and converted to clinically definite MS after the vaccination. A case of ADEM following exposure to HPV vaccine was recently reported and under the assumption that ADEM and MS share some pathophysiological and clinical features, it is conceivable that an immunological stimulus capable of inducing a monophasic deregulated immune response in the CNS could potentially lead to a relapsing-remitting chronic course.  It is plausible that in genetically predisposed individuals, the immunological stimulus of a vaccine or even some immunomodulatory therapies may lead to a deranged immune response that could theoretically trigger an autoimmune disease. In this view, the particularly aggressive course of disease demonstrated by the patient in case No 2 could be the result of such a stimulation that could not be controlled with a first line immunomodulatory therapy.  Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (Types 6,11,16,18) Recomb. Vaccine (GARDASIL) has raised no concerns about the risks of transmission of the HPV and the benefits of vaccines are undeniable as several diseases can only be treated by active vaccinations. HPV is the causative agent of a potentially highly morbid illness and its prevention will have a large social impact. Considering the overall limited number of adverse events recorded thus far, it is likely that the benefits outweigh the risks of complications. However, we feel that collecting long term data on the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine and documenting the adverse events is imperative.  Upon internal review, the patient's adverse event was determined to be other important medical event since it was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone.  This is one of several reports received from the same source. The second patient was captured in MARRS# 1110USA01072.

Patient stated that she has gotten the flu vaccine before and never had any problems. She also stated she knows that if the vaccine isn't given in the correct location, that it could cause an injury. She says that the day after receiving the vaccine, her arm became red and swollen until that Friday 10/09/2020 and that since then, the redness and swelling has resolved, but she has had progressively worsening pain since then. She says that the pain is present both with and without movement but is most notable in the sitting position. Patient was advised by pharmacist to seek medical attention if deemed necessary. On Tuesday 10/20/2020 patient contacted the pharmacy to update that she is beginning to feel a lump in the area where the vaccine was administered and that she has scheduled an appointment with an orthopedic doctor for Wednesday 10/21/2020. She will follow up with the pharmacy on any pertient details or results of the appointment.  The immunizing pharmacist has undergone injection technique training and completed a quality care check on vaccine administration. Upon watching surveillance footage of the time the patient presented for the vaccine, the camera angle does not allow full visibility to the entire event to determine if the vaccine was administered in the right location of the deltoid. However, it was noted that the patient was wearing a short sleeve shirt and therefore most likely rolled the sleeve up above her shoulder to expose the entire deltoid muscle. Typically, shoulder injury related to vaccine administration is more likely if the patient is wearing a long sleeve shirt that they aren't able to fully roll up above the shoulder or if they are pulling their shirt down at the neckline because in both instances, the deltoid muscle is not fully exposed. This was not the case with this patient. After having received the vaccine, the patient can clearly be seen walking away unremarkably, never holding her arm or appearing to be in any distress or discomfort from being immunized.",,,,,,,,,N,10/06/2020,10/07/2020,1,,PHM,,,,,,,2,10/20/2020,,Y,,

Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of blistering autoimmune skin reaction/Bullous pemphigoid (BP) in a 74-years old female patient, who was vaccinated with SHINGRIX (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis. The patient was female. The patient had history of ulcerative proctosigmoiditis, controlled with fiber supplement, diphenoxylate/atropine, and mesalamine as needed.

No information on patient's family history was provided. On an unspecified date in April 2019, the patient received 1st dose of SHINGRIX (administration route and site unspecified; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided but it could be 73 years or 74 years. On an unspecified date in 2019, 40 days after the 1st dose of vaccination, new rash initially started and appeared erythematous with raised pustules. [The new rash initially started 40 days after her first SHINGRIX vaccination and appeared erythematous with raised pustules]. The patient also developed redness, blisters, and burning on the right side of her face. The patient denied fevers, joint pains, chest pain, shortness of breath or cough. The patient was initially prescribed valacyclovir 1000 mg three times daily for presumed diagnosis of shingles. Despite compliance, the patient was noted to have erythematous plaque-like eruption over the right eye that crossed the midline and was ��mildly weepy"", along with papular outbreaks around both ears, left upper arm, and right hand. The patient was then treated with cephalexin and terbinafine, however the rash continued to worsen. The patient underwent a biopsy and culture of the rash which showed no growth of aerobic bacteria or fungi. On histology, the biopsy showed ��intra-epidermal blister with eosinophils"" with comment of ��spongiotic vesicles contain eosinophils, as does the upper part of the dermis"" and that the findings were evidence for either ��re-epithelialized lesions of bullous pemphigoid or an intra-epidermal acantholytic dermatosis such as pemphigus vulgaris."" Direct immunofluorescence studies, likely for antibodies such as Desmoglein 1, 3, bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 and BP 230 for the autoimmune bullous diseases, were recommended by the pathology laboratory, but not obtained by the clinician. It was recommended to correlate with clinical findings. The rash completely resolved after a 20-day steroid taper with topical corticosteroid for 1-2 weeks and then only as needed for flares. On an unspecified date, less than two months after finishing the steroid taper, the patient received 2nd dose of SHINGRIX (administration route and site unspecified; batch number not provided). On an unspecified date, within less than 2 months after the 2nd dose of vaccination, the patient had recurrence of the same rash. The patient was treated with oral corticosteroid for one week, and the rash resolved. [Less than two months after finishing the steroid taper, the patient received the second dose of SHINGRIX and had recurrence of the same rash. The second rash occurrence, treatment, and resolution all occurred within less than 2 months of receiving the second vaccination. The patient presented on two occasions with a rash on her face (forehead, cheeks, ears), anterior chest, arms, legs, and abdomen after receiving the SHINGRIX vaccine in April 2019]. The author commented, ""There have been multiple accounts of inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients developing autoimmune blistering skin disorders, and in some cases, these have been associated with specific triggers such as vaccination. Some studies have proposed mechanisms for the pathophysiology of these associations, however there is not a clear consensus on the cause. In terms of overall frequency, one review of 48 cases of patients with autoimmune skin diseases and IBD reported that the most frequently occurring autoimmune skin diseases were linear IgA disease and BP. Another study concluded that pemphigus was significantly associated with ulcerative colitis (UC) with an odds ratio of 1.9 but did not hypothesize a mechanism. BP has also been reported in multiple infants after HSV-1 herpetic stomatitis and after vaccination against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, and H. influenzae type b. This study confirmed the presence of BP antigen 180 and resolution of symptoms with oral prednisone treatment. The authors thought that trauma from vaccine injection could have led to activation of Th17 cells and IL-17 production causing proteolytic enzyme and cytokine induced blister formation. These proposed mechanisms share the unifying theme of a specific environmental trigger from vaccination causing an increased immune response that manifests on the skin. We believe there to be enough evidence amongst these studies in the current literature to support a possible association between a vaccination and the development of specific autoimmune disorders, particularly in those who may be predisposed to autoimmune conditions. Additionally, the recurrence of the same reaction after each dose of a vaccine (a positive re-challenge) is further confirmation of a causal association between the vaccine and an adverse reaction. Given the temporal relationship between vaccination, the development of BP, and resolution with steroids with each dose of SHINGRIX, we believe that the SHINGRIX vaccine led to the development of BP in this patient.""",,,,,,,,,Y,04/01/2019,,,"Test Name: Biopsy of the rash; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result: no growth of aerobic bacteria or fungi, Unit: unknown); Test Name: culture of the rash; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result: no growth of aerobic bacteria or fungi, Unit: unknown); Test Name: histology; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result: see text, Unit: unknown); Comments: Lab test done on an unknown date in 2019.

I asked many questions and she stated she has had the flu shot many times with no issues only to the tetnus vaccine. I placed a cool cloth on her neck and tried to get her to relax as she was responsive but the itching continued as I advised about an Epi-pen but she can't have them she stated. The other collegues in the office at the time had benadryl so she took one 25mg tablet at 12:10 as the itching is what bothered her. She sat and relaxed, went to the bathroom as she felt nauseous but did not vomit. It seemed to get better than about 1:00pm her eyes were burning again/appeared glassy and she felt very clammy so I called paramedics. They arrived on scene, took vitals, listened to lungs and were clear. Advised they could take her to the ER, it seemed the bendryl was helping but the delayed reaction one is not able to tell the severity of it. She delined the ER.

I could not get in to see my doctor until Monday October 19th, and I did not go to the ER because I was not experiencing any life threatening symptoms.  On Monday my doctor diagnosed me with Bell's Palsy which she said was related to an infection.  I spoke with a nurse at my doctors office that had worked for VAERS for many years, and she is the one who suggested that this was probably a vaccine reaction since there were not other evident causes of the Bell's Palsy, and because I started having problems just days after receiving the flu shot.  My doctor placed me on a high dose prednisone prescription with the hope that it would decrease the inflammation of the facial nerve, and start to restore facial function.  as of today, October 22nd, the only change in symptom I have is a decrease in the numbness on the right side of my tongue.",,,,,,,,Y,N,10/07/2020,10/11/2020,4,Physical and Neurological exam including the accessory muscles.,PHM,,Aurovela Fe Cranberry Supplements Vita Fusion Women's Supplement,UTI Impetigo,Migraines,,,2,10/22/2020,,Y,,none

It was unknown if the reporter considered the extremities hot feeling of, swelling arm, pain in arm, pain in elbow, shoulder pain, muscle soreness, tiredness and allergic reaction to drug excipient to be related to Bexsero.  Additional details were provided as follows: The case was reported by the mother of patient. The age at vaccination was not reported. The patient had latex allergy that was contact induced such as band aids and latex gloves and had sulfa allergy.  The patient had blocked tear duct and sulfa eye drops were prescribed which made her whole face red and swollen. A few years later the patient got a urinary tract infection and was prescribed sulfa as a tablet and again had a reaction to it. This time her whole body was red like a sunburn and she had to take Benadryl. The patient received Bexsero vaccine and her whole arm from her elbow to her shoulder was hot, swollen, tender, and she was experiencing muscle soreness. The patient was also super tired (took naps in the afternoon and went to bed around 9). The reporter asked if there was sulfa in this vaccine. The reporter stated that reading the page, she saw that it did contain latex. The patient was allergic to latex and sulfa drugs. The reporter stated that there should be warnings to the doctors letting them know what is in the vaccines so they do not unnecessarily harm children and young adults. There were a lot of people allergic to latex and should try your best to come up with a product that did not incorporate latex. The reporter was called back and she indicated that the patient received the Bexsero at around 10 am in the morning at the pediatrician's office. The reporter said that patient's whole arm was hot with sharp pain from her elbow up to her shoulder. It was hot and tender and swollen. On the day of reporting, in the morning the patient got up to go to school and after taking Advil. She said that her arm was just a muscle ache (no longer a sharp pain) so it seemed to be resolving. The patient did not have a fever. The reporter indicated that she was surprised that this happened because it seemed like an adverse reaction more harsh than any other vaccine the patient had ever received.

She said that at the time you could see the hole where the needle had pierced the rubber stopper but you cannot see it anymore thus she will not be sending any pictures.

The patient's medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received a flu vaccine, but never experienced side effects.   On 13-Oct-2020, in the morning, the patient was vaccinated with Fluad Quadrivalent (influenza vaccine, inactivated influenza virus surface antigen (subunit), egg-derived, mf59; dose: 0.5 ml, route of administration: intramuscular; anatomical location: left deltoid) as protection against seasonal influenza. The batch number was not reported. It was confirmed that it was 2020-2021 formulation.  On the same day, after receiving Fluad Quadrivalent, around 3 pm, the patient developed a headache that continued to get worse and worse as the day progressed. By the end of the day the patient was very sick and 'thought she was going to die'. The patient lived alone and that frightened her. She stated it got to the point where she felt like she had the flu, was unable to walk and that even trying to move around hurt so much that she cried and was incapacitated. The patient was very nauseated, unable to eat a lot during this time and also felt very weak. No corrective treatment was applied for events.  At the time of initial reporting on 16-Oct-2020, the patient was recovering from events, as until that date the patient did not see some of these issues started to lessen and she still felt very weak and was still nauseated, but it was not as bad as it was from 13-Oct 2020 to 15-Oct-2020.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  The event of 'disability' and 'flu' was considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  Company comment: Disability, influenza, fear of death, fear, gait inability, pain, crying, feeding disorder, asthenia, nausea, headache and malaise were associated with the use of the suspect product - Fluad Quadrivalent. Chronology seems very suggestive and possibly related for influenza, gait inability, pain, feeding disorder, asthenia, nausea, headache and malaise and unrelated for fear of death, fear and crying.; Sender's Comments: Disability, influenza, fear of death, fear, gait inability, pain, crying, feeding disorder, asthenia, nausea, headache and malaise were associated with the use of the suspect product - Fluad Quadrivalent.

The batch number reported was 279794 and expiration date 29-May-2021.  On the same day, the HCP was worried that some of the patient's blood might have gotten on her (due to the needle in the patient's arm) but said that she did not notice that it happened.  At the time of initial reporting on 01-Sep-2020, the outcome of the event was not reported.  The reporter did not provide a causality assessment.  This case has been entered onto Seqirus's manufacturing quality assurance tracking database and allocated reference number 1065599.  An investigation into batch 279794 did not reveal anything that could account for events 'worry', 'occupational exposure while administering product' and 'syringe leak'. Quality Assurance investigation for this product complaint concluded that there was no manufacturing fault that led to the leaking luer lock during administration. The most likely cause for this complaint was improper handling of the syringe during the attachment of the needle to the luer lock. Historically the use of safety needles had led to an increase in number of leaking syringe complaints due to the complexity of the safety needle apparatus. During the attachment the complexity of the safety needle apparatus led to the user not attaching the needle tightly, thus caused a leak. In addition, there was no trend present for leaking luer locks as the current defect rate for Fluad Drug Product was two Defects/Million and there was also no trend within batch 279794.  This case is linked to case 202004284 (due to the same reporter).

0892671,10/26/2020,CA,73.0,73,,F,,After a few hours of muscle ache which is usual high pain began. By late evening I could no longer lift my arm over my head due to intense pain.  By the morning following the shot I could no longer move my arm at all without searing pain.  I had to immobilize it with my other hand.  Over the course of the next three days I took Ibuprofen and then switched to Tylenol. I called the Nurse hotline on day three of the pain where I still could not raise my arm over my head but was able to move my arm with some pain. I was told if it did not get better to go to urgent care the next day. The next day it seemed pain was still sharp but diminished and the pain continued to diminish until almost 2 weeks beyond the shot.  At that point it was still painful but tolerable so that I could perform most duties. Then around 2 weeks the sharp pains began to come back more and again it was very uncomfortable to raise my arm high. It also is painful when I turn my body during rest and lay on it.  I made an appt with my GP for 10/29/20. In the meantime he told me to take Ibuprofen daily. It still is painful but the pain is bearable.

The exanthem does not bother her and reassurance given that this should continue to resolve over the next 1-2 weeks on its own. Reassurance it is not vesicular and not varicella. This could be viral related however it could also be related to the fact that she just received her MMR about 1.5 weeks prior to initial onset of the exanthem.

But that is the least of my problems.  Shot rec'd on Friday.  By Sunday night I tried to do something simple like squeeze a tube of toothpaste and not only was I completely unable to do it, it was incredibly painful in my arm. And I yelped!!   In the last month I am still having much difficulty -- the arm wakes me up at night.   I have pains when I am lying still doing nothing.  Doing simple  tasks like pulling a plug out of an outlet or a USB drive out....pain stops me.  I can not lift anything that weights over 2 pounds.  I tried.  Yelped big time on that one!! I reported this to the pharmacy.  They advised that they know of no system in place to report my problem.  I was quite surprised since in my search for help and relief I found this website.  Store did nicely write my name on a piece of paper.  Said they would note it in the computer and told me to call pharmacy Corporate Office.  You can't get through to anyone there.   It is  my feeling that the pharmacist on duty this day that gave me the flu shot either used too long of needle for my small arm or he did a back stick and he hit a nerve or something --  an older man with gray hair and glasses (don't recall a name) with a face not familiar to me as this is my regular pharmacy.   I say nerve because of the stabbing pains I get while doing absolutely nothing with my arm.  Prior to this I have had NO problems with  my arm and I now have about half the use of it.

It felt a bit ""thick"" going in, but I was not sure what that meant.   Within  a few hours of having the injection, my muscle felt a bit sore - which is the usual reaction -  but by midafternoon 3:30 pm, there was this very intense pain on the front of my shoulder,  that did not feel muscular.   It intensified into the evening until I went to bed around 9 pm and took 600MG of Advil to calm the pain.  I awoke around 2:30 with such pain in front of my arm, I was awake for about an hour and then took 400 mg of Advil to return to some unrestful sleep as I could not get comfortable.  This has continued every night since - icing the front of my shoulder and taking 600 mg of Advil before sleep and then being awakened between 2-3:30 am due to the pain in my arm.    It is difficult to get comfortable even with the ice and Advil.  During the day on Saturday 10/17, Sunday 10/18 the pain was evident all day but most excruciating when I attempted to move my right arm back - to put my hand in my right pant or jacket pocket or to pull up my pants on the right side.  Additionally, I could not buckle with my right hand but had to reach over with my left.     There were times over those two days and every day since that moving my right arm just the slightest ?wrong way? causes such excruciating pain, it takes my breath away.   On Monday 10/19 I called to make a doctor?s appointment, but they could not see me for two days. I already had a previously schedule PT appointment for Wednesday 10/21, that I did not need for the previous issues but decided to keep it and have MPT examine my shoulder and arm and make a diagnosis.  She examined me and wrote her observations which can be obtained at Physical Therapy.  She recommended to ice it whenever it hurts and limit any range of motions that aggravated it but to do hanging circles to keep the shoulder moving and reduce the risk of frozen shoulder.  We made a follow-up appointment for 10/26. 10/25/20 The pain continues every day and night and has severely restricted my active lifestyle.  It has also interrupted any sense of restful sleep as I am aware of the pain every time I turn over and awakened every morning between 2-3:30AM.  This lack of restful sleep severely affects my ability to be clearheaded and productive in my job.  10/26/20 I visited Physical Therapist again today at 7:45 am.   She did some laser therapy and some message and taped it with KT tape.  She believes that either a tendon or bursae were struck with the needle and that is what is causing the pain.  She also explained that this could be a 4-6-week recovery. My shoulder felt calm when I left PT and for about 7 hours.

March 16th - patient  was brought to the Clinic and prescribed amoxicillin for a double ear infection.  March 19th - patient was brought to hospital for his 1 year vaccinations. (Note: he has never had any adverse reactions to vaccinations yet).  March 22nd - I noticed a few red dots on patient's chest in the evening.  March 23rd - In the morning, patient's chest had the same number of pink/red dots as the day prior. I sent him to daycare because he didn't have a fever and wasn't acting sick. I asked the daycare provider to monitor the spots and let me know how he was. As the day progressed, the pink/red dots continued to get worse and he was crying/screaming in pain when his arms/legs were moved. It was visibly noticeable that his elbows and knees were red, swollen and warm and he was experiencing some sort of joint pain. I scheduled an appointment with hospital to be seen that day. We saw Dr. and he said he was obviously having an allergic reaction to something, he assumed the amoxicillin. I had mentioned that he had been vaccinated on Monday the 19th and after a lot of internet searching, it kept coming back that it could be a reaction to the MMR vaccine. It noted that ""because the measles, mumps, and rubella viruses in the MMR vaccine are weak versions of the disease viruses, they may cause a very mild case of the disease they were designed to prevent."" Dr. indicated that he had never seen such a case, so he didn't think it would be that. As the night progressed, the red dots only continued to get worse. Patient was given 2 mL of Benadryl that evening per doctor.  March 24th - patient was given 2 mL of Zyrtec at 9:00 a.m. per doctor. The day old red/pinks dots were now bruise like in appearance and new red/pink dots were appearing. He was having horrific joint pain; screaming, crying and inconsolable for over an hour (until ibuprofen kicked in again).   March 25th - The majority of the dots were disappearing, but still visible. No joint pain all day.  March 26th - Almost all of the dots are gone. No joint pain.   NOTE; I have quite a few pictures on my cell phone documenting the progression of the reaction that I would be happy to send to someone.

0893183,10/28/2020,,,,,M,,"GBS following the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13); This is a literature report  INTRODUCTION: Guillian Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute immune mediated polyneuropathy which presents as monophasic paralyzing illness typically provoked by a preceding infection. The overall incidence of GBS is 1-2 cases a year per 100,000. An increased risk of GBS has been associated with the influenza vaccination. Despite the association of GBS with the influenza vaccine, there are limited cases of GBS documented with the pneumococcal vaccination. Authors present a case of GBS following the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). CASE PRESENTATION: 61-year-old male with a past medical history of a stroke, coronary artery disease, and hypertension presented with lower extremity weakness and decreased sensation. He reported tingling in his feet which had been progressing up to his knees, with associated weakness. He had received PCV13 2 weeks prior to admission. He denied upper respiratory infections, or diarrhea. Lab were significant for leukocytosis 13.0 cells/microL. Muscle strength was 1/5 in the left lower extremity and 3/5 in the right lower extremity. Sensory motor deficits were noted up to the level of the mid shin bilaterally. Lumbar puncture demonstrated 0 RBCs, glucose 65 mg/dL, and protein elevated 79 mg/dL. CSF culture was negative. Nerve conduction study revealed evidence of severe sensorimotor demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Work-up including a viral respiratory panel and influenza nasal swab were negative. The patient was started on intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) infusion at 1 g/kg once daily for a total of 5 days. DISCUSSION: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a rare acute flaccid paralysis syndrome commonly preceded by symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection or diarrhea within the prior 3 months. The underlying etiology of GBS remains unclear, but the pathophysiology in most cases of GBS is due to stimulation of autoimmunity that produces auto-immune antibodies that attack the myelin sheath of the nerves in the peripheral nervous system. In the case of this patient, he appropriately received PPSV23 prior to 65 years of age because of his chronic lung disease but he did not have a compelling indication to receive PCV13. There is inconclusive data that the greater immunogenicity of PCV13 leads to a higher incidence of immune reactions potentially leading to GBS. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal vaccination is generally safe and effective with a very low chance for serious adverse events. Carefully administering PCV13 when truly indicated can further minimize the potential for harm. The development of injection site reactions should be carefully monitored as higher IgG-specific antibody titers could increase risk of GBS. Despite some of the recent reports of GBS associated with the pneumococcal vaccine, the overall benefit of preventing life-threatening infections largely outweighs the potential risks for adverse drug events.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of pneumococcal 13-Val Conj Vac (Dipht CRM197 Protein) the country of incidence.

The subject did not use tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy.   The subject's last menstrual period (LMP) date was 25-Jun-2020, estimated delivery date (EDD) was reported as 01-Apr-2021 and corrected estimated date of delivery (CEDD) was reported as 02-Apr-2021. The type of pregnancy was singleton.   On 11-Sep-2020, at gestational age of 11 weeks (calculated per LMP), the subject was vaccinated with Afluria QIV (Flu Vaccine Egg Split QIV CSL) (influenza vaccine; dose, route of administration and  anatomical location: not reported) (explicitly coded as 'Vaccine exposure during pregnancy') for influenza immunisation. The batch number reported was P100230203.   On the same day, ultrasound, Counsyl fundamental panel with fragile X and Counsyl chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and sex chromosome analysis revealed no MCMs.  On the same day, after receiving Afluria QIV, it was determined that the subject was group B Streptococcus carrier.  On 28-Sep-2020, 17 days after receiving Afluria QIV, the patient developed human papilloma virus infection (HPV) with Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I (CIN 1)  At the time of initial reporting on 21-Oct-2020, the patient had not recovered from the events 'cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I', 'human papilloma virus infection' and 'bacterial infection due to streptococcus, group B'.   The reporter did not provide a causality assessment to Afluria QIV.  The events 'cervical intraepithelial neoplasia I', 'human papilloma virus infection' and 'bacterial infection due to streptococcus, group B' were considered to be medically significant by a Physician within Seqirus's Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department.  Company comment: Cervical dysplasia, papilloma viral infection and beta haemolytic streptococcal infection were associated with the use of the suspect product - Afluria QIV. Bacterial infection was detected the same day after vaccination (chronology suggestive) and other two 17 days after (chronology plausible). Causality is assessed as unrelated for streptococcal infection (due to biological implausibility) and also unrelated for other two events. Presence of papilloma infection may be the cause of cervical dysplasia and human papillomavirus is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). Exposure during pregnancy  is assessed as unrelated per company conventions.; Sender's Comments: Cervical dysplasia, papilloma viral infection and beta haemolytic streptococcal infection were associated with the use of the suspect product - Afluria QIV.

[She had received the Shingrix vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline) 3 days prior to presentation in the left deltoid]. On an unspecified date, within hours after the vaccination, the patient developed fevers, chills, diaphoresis, left-sided headache, and prickly sensation in both hands. The patient presented with acute onset of worsening left periocular swelling and diplopia for 2 days. The patient later noted left-sided upper eyelid drooping and left-sided tearing 1 day prior to presentation and presented to an outside emergency department 2 days after the vaccination. Her initial emergency room record, prior to ophthalmology evaluation, showed no evidence of ptosis or tearing in either eye, and CT head scan on presentation found stable left sinus disease. The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of sinusitis and prescribed oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10 days and fluticasone nasal spray (50 mcg/actuation) 1 spray nightly for 28 days for sinusitis. The next day the patient presented to institution's emergency department with left-sided eye pain and swelling and new-onset diplopia. Ophthalmology was then consulted, at her second ED visit, but first evaluation with ophthalmology. The patient denied discharge, irritation, foreign body sensation, floaters, flashes, shade over vision, blurred vision, sudden vision loss, photophobia. Ophthalmological examination revealed visual acuity of 20/20 in each eye, normal pupillary exam, and intraocular pressures of 16 and 21 mm Hg in the OD and OS, respectively. Visual field examination revealed limited ability to count fingers in the superior field of the OS. Extraocular motility was reduced in the OS (-3 in upgaze and -1 in adduction). Hertel exophthalmometry at a base of 100 mm was 12 mm on the OD and 16 mm OS). Margin reflex distance was 2 mm in the OD and -1 mm on the OS. The left lacrimal gland region appeared without induration or tenderness. The patient had edema and erythema of the left upper and lower eyelids, and her left temporal bulbar conjunctiva was injected and chemotic [On presentation, the patient had erythema and edema of the left upper and lower eyelids, left ptosis, left elevation deficit, and left proptosis]. The rest of the ocular exam was otherwise unremarkable. The patient was afebrile on presentation with a blood cell count of 10.9 k/uL. Orbital CT revealed left preseptal thickening with enhancement, and a small focal thickening adjacent to the left lamina papyracea thought to represent subperiosteal phlegmonous change or early abscess, with confluent opacification of the left anterior ethmoid air cells. The left inferior and medial rectus muscles appeared enlarged with sparing on the tendons. [Coronal CT scan of the orbits on presentation, showing enlarged left medial and inferior rectus muscles. The patient was also noted to have left ethmoid, maxillary, and frontal sinus thickening]. The patient was admitted to initiate intravenous vancomycin (1.25 gm every 12 hours) and ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours), and oxymetazoline nasal sprays (2 sprays, twice daily), nasal saline irrigation (60 mL to each nostril, twice daily), and fluticasone (2 sprays in each nare, daily). Over the next 18 hours, the left-sided proptosis increased to 6 mm and remained stable over the following day, without any changes in vision, extraocular motility, or cranial nerve exam. Autoimmune workup showed a normal WBC, TSI, ANA, ACE, ANCA, and IgG4. Other serologic testing included ESR = 72 mm/hour (normal 0-20 mm/hour), C-reactive protein = 9.4 mg/dl (normal less than 0.9 mg/dl), and rheumatoid factor = 17 IU/ml (normal less than 16 IU/ml). Thirty-six hours after admission, intravenous solumedrol, 250 mg every 6 hours, was initiated. Nine hours after initiation of steroids, the patient noted drastic improvement in her discomfort and double vision. Extraocular motility improved to -0.5 in upgaze and -0.5 adduction and proptosis was reduced to 3 mm. Approximately 24 hours after initiating IV solumedrol, the proptosis had reduced to 2 mm, with stable extraocular motility (-0.5 in upgaze and -0.5 adduction). The patient was discharged for outpatient management prednisone taper starting at 60 mg orally per day and oral antibiotics. Follow-up examination 1 week after discharge revealed visual acuity of 20/20 in each eye, Hertel exophthalmometry of 12 mm in each eye at a base of 100 mm, full extraocular motility and resolved eyelid edema and erythema. The patient finished her course of oral steroids 15 days later without evidence of relapse. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization.  The author commented, ""This case of unilateral ptosis, proptosis, and orbital myositis occurred within 2 days after administration of shingles vaccination. Shingrix has a high level of efficacy in reducing the incidence of zoster infection, with 97.2% efficacy in those more than 50 years of age and 89.8% in those more than 70. The most common side effects with Shingrix vaccine included local pain, redness, and swelling and generalized effects such as myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, fever, and GI symptoms. No publications were found of new ocular or orbital inflammation after administration of shingles vaccines. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) presents in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Typically, HZO is associated with pain and a periocular vesicular rash in the CN V1 distribution. HZO may also present with eyelid changes (rash, secondary bacterial infection), conjunctival injection and chemosis, corneal changes (pseudodendrites, punctate epithelial keratitis, stromal keratitis, nummular keratitis), uveitis (cell and flare, synechiae, iris atrophy), retinal findings (acute retinal necrosis, progressive outer retinal necrosis), and postherpetic neuralgia. HZO has less commonly been reported to present with orbital inflammation. Case reports include diffuse orbital inflammation and myositis; however, the patient reported here had no other signs or symptoms of HZO. Given the temporal relation with the shingles vaccination, no occurrence of vesicles or rash, and rapid resolution after steroid treatment, the authors propose that this patient experienced an autoimmune reaction to the shingles vaccine. There are alternative possibilities for the presentation. As discussed above, orbital myositis has been described with use of statin medications, which was a long-term medication for the patient. While a serum creatine kinase (CK) level was not obtained in this case, an elevated CK level may have strengthened the diagnosis of orbital myositis. Additionally, if orbital symptoms recurred on the second dose of Shingrix, this may further strength the association between Shingrix and orbital myositis; however, the authors did not obtain patient approval to evaluate this. The likelihood of ADR is separated in 4 categories: doubtful, possible, probably, and definite. Based on that scale, this reaction would be considered possible and the authors propose that this reaction to Shingrix is possible but not definitive. No clear conclusions have been made in the literature as to the mechanism of vaccine-related autoimmune conditions. Vaccine adjuvants may cause an orbital or systemic myositis presentation, and the adjuvants may inadvertently cause an autoimmune myositis. This case of orbital myositis occurring after Shingrix vaccine expands the known list of vaccines that may produce orbital inflammation; however, the exact pathophysiology of orbital inflammation in the context of vaccination remains to be elucidated.""",,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,"Test Name: Autoimmune workup ACE; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Test Name: Autoimmune workup ANCA; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Test Name: Autoimmune workup ANA; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Test Name: Autoimmune workup IgG4; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Test Name: blood cell count; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:10.9,Unit:K/uL); Test Name: Orbital CT/Coronal CT scan; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: CT head scan; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: C-reactive protein; Test Result:  9.4 mg/dl; Test Name: intraocular pressure; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:16 and 21 mm Hg in the OD and OS, respectively,Unit:unknown); Test Name: Ophthalmological examination; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: normal pupillary exam; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Test Name: ESR; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:72,Unit:mm/hr); Test Name: rheumatoid factor; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:17,Unit:iu/ml); Test Name: Autoimmune workup TSI; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Test Name: visual acuity test; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:20/20 in each eye,Unit:unknown); Test Name: visual acuity test; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:20/20 in each eye in follow-up examination,Unit:unknown); Test Name: Visual field examination; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:see text,Unit:unknown); Test Name: Autoimmune workup WBC; Result Unstructured Data: (Test Result:normal,Unit:unknown); Comments: Lab test done on an unknown date.

On an unknown date, the outcome of the injection site itching, red rash, maculopapular rash, itchy rash, weakness of limbs, headache, myalgia, malaise, numbness of limbs and skin lesion were recovering/resolving.   The reporter considered the injection site itching, red rash, maculopapular rash, itchy rash, weakness of limbs, headache, myalgia, malaise, numbness of limbs and skin lesion to be related to Shingrix.  Additional details were provided as follows: This case was reported in a literature article and described the occurrence of injection site itching; injection site rash (diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash); feeling of numbness and weakness in both legs; headache, myalgia, and malaise in a 54-years old female patient, who was vaccinated with Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for prophylaxis. The patient had no significant past medical history. No information on patient's medical history, family history, concurrent condition or concomitant medication was provided. On an unspecified date, the patient received Shingrix (administration route and site unspecified, dosage unknown; batch number not provided). The age of vaccination was not provided. On an unspecified date, an unknown period after the vaccination, the patient presented with diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash, itching and a feeling of weakness in both legs. The patient's symptoms started with itching and erythematous macular rash at the site of shingles shot followed by headache, myalgia, and malaise which did not improve much with Benadryl. The next day, the patient felt numbness and weakness in both legs. On the third day, the patient awoke with a diffuse red rash on the face, trunk, lower extremities, fewer lesions on upper extremities. Her review of systems was negative except as mentioned. On examination, the patient was found to have a diffuse erythematous maculopapular pruritic rash, but no sensory, motor, cranial never or cerebellar signs. Infectious disease was consulted who recommended IV acyclovir considering early varicella with given morphology. The morphology of lesions did not change over a period of times and the VZV PCR of lesions came negative hence acyclovir was discontinued after three days. The patient's symptoms and rash improved over the hospital stay with supportive treatment, and the patient was discharged home on the fifth day of admission. This case has been considered as serious due to hospitalization. The author commented, ""Shingrix is recommended by the Committee as the preferred shingles vaccine over live zoster vaccine (Zostavax) to prevent shingles and postherpetic neuralgia in immunocompetent adults age 50 years and older. The safety of shingrix was evaluated from the pool date of 8 clinical trials of more than 10,000 participants which showed 17% of vaccine recipients had grade 3 adverse events (preventing normal everyday activities). Grade 3 injection-site reactions (pain, redness, and swelling) were reported by 9.4% of vaccine recipients and grade 3 solicited systemic events (myalgia, fatigue, headache, shivering, fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms) were reported by 10.8% of vaccine recipients. For grade 3 reactions, the median duration was 1 day for all systemic reactions and pain and 2 days for redness and swelling. The nature and duration of rash described in our patient has not been documented in any of the clinical trials."" The author concluded, ""Emergence of new adverse reactions which have not been reported are plausible with broader use of vaccine.
