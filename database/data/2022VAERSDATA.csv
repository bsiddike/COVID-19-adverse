No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.   Additional information: This past Friday afternoon and received booster shot for COVID vaccine. Within less than 24 hours he started to experience diarrheal discharge of both goop and intestinal matter. It continued for about a day and a half maybe two. One was to drink Gatorade and he did that and to eat bland stuff. The diarrhea, at least temporarily was discontinuing. The doctors office said to take a container with the stuff to the local clinic in (withheld). He did that this morning. They were not interested and sent him to get COVID tested and he did that. Now they tell him that he would be informed after a couple of days. He was not scheduled for an appointment with a physician today. He did not know if this is over yet. It was not very pleasant. He tried to call VAERS and the only thing they were good for sending him a form to fill out. Caller has no indication it has been reported including at the clinic. He talked with a nurse and got COVID test. It has tapered off after he drank Gatorade and did not eat very much. He has only had a couple of ripe bananas and toast over 24 hour period. And Gatorade that has no sugar. He took a couple Ricola candies and those went down ok. Prior to that he was drinking water and had cut down on medication and practically everything else. Finally he stopped passing whatever. Initially it was coming out like chocolatey goop. Then the very last one occurred last night. After most of it had dissipated, it was a couple of farts and couple of blood drops. He did not notice blood in prior discharges. It got all over everything. Once it was going to come it was going to come. It was not pleasant. From what has been said to him continuing and disabling diarrhea was not associated with booster shot yet. That was what he has heard. Loss of fluid has been pointed out to him several times as a dangerous situation. It has tapered off after he drank Gatorade and did not eat very much.   Description of complaint: Caller reporting adverse event with booster shot for COVID vaccine. The reason he got it was because the first and second shot seemed to be very settling for him. With limited medical background, his impression is either the first or second may have settled and activated the immune system with the other viral complications which were documented over the years. That is a wild guess. He w  as very surprised there was a reaction to this. It could be an over reaction of immune system. They sent him to get COVID nasal test. In 2 days he will get the results. If for some reason he has acquired disimmunity there will be more questions.    No follow-up attempts are possible.

Additional information: The patient was taking Pfizer Covid Vaccine because she felt the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the potential risks. No investigation assessment. The patient just wanted to report some of the side effects she's been experiencing after having the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. They had all been mild. She had the initial injection done at approximately 1445 yesterday afternoon. It has been almost 24 hours but not quite. She experienced soreness in the arm in the injection site. It was nothing terrible, probably a 2 or 3 on the pain scale. She also noticed last evening some tension and stiffness going up from the injection site from her shoulder and neck to the base at the back of her head. It was temporary for a short time and went away. The other symptom she noticed which was a little unusual was she woke up this morning and noticed her gums in her mouth were swollen and tender to the touch. It is very mild and has decreased as she has been up since she woke up this morning. It is a little unusual, but she knows there are glands under the jaw which could explain it, she could have a potential autoimmune reaction. She worked in home health for 3 years in the office, not as an actual medical provider. While it is not quite the same thing, her mother is an occupational therapist and when she was young her mother was going through school, and she learned a lot through her. She also worked at an attorney's office for 3 years and her primary responsibility was going through medical records of clients. She declines to provide an email address. She honestly does not know her weight. She estimates around 150. She declined to provide a primary physician. The soreness in her arm started yesterday and it was mild. Within an hour of the injection, she noticed it. She had received tips from friends and family who have received it, and they said arm movement would reduce the amount of soreness over 24 hours. She was moving her arm regularly yesterday. The soreness was at its peak when she first woke up this morning. It is only when she extends her arm out and to the side and up and away from her body. It does not hurt moving it forward or back as much. It is primarily in her upper arm region, probably within 2 to 3 inches above and below the injection site. It is mainly muscle soreness. It is worse than it was yesterday. She did also want to say since she woke up this morning is has not been worse but steady since this morning. The tension and stiffness started approximately 3 hours after the injection. It was very mild, and it didn't last the entire evening. She only noticed it for 2 hours. She could feel it creeping up her shoulder to her neck and the back of the base of her skull. It went away. The tenderness and swelling in her gums has decreased since she has been up and ambulatory. It is still tender but not as much as when she woke up. It did not prevent her from eating or drinking. She has not received any treatment; she has not even taken anything over the counter. Indication for Pfizer Covid Vaccine, she felt the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the potential risks in the emergency use vaccine. She also took it to prevent herself from contracting Covid-19 and to stop the spread to others. She is taking no medications that would be relevant. Any medication she was taking she has been on regularly, so nothing would have caused anything new. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. The AE did not result in emergency room or physician office visit. She did not even treat herself with over-the-counter medications. The most severe symptom is the arm pain and that is only when it is out and to the side. At a maximum it is a 3 on the pain scale. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. No family medical history relevant to ae(s). No relevant tests.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vaccination failure, covid-19. Additional information: The patient got two doses of the vaccine and wanted to know when she can start her Methotrexate, when she can return to that medication because she had to stop for like 2 weeks or more because she received the vaccine, and the only medication she could take was ibuprofen. Patient reported that she was crippled with arthritis and had second shot (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 27Jun2021 at 8 in the morning. Patient can hardly walk with her arthritis and have been staying off all my medications so she can get a shot. She had to take Tramadol, she was done. Patient mentioned that she almost died when she had Covid as she was over 30 days in the hospital for Covid, and patient think she got it because she was being on Methotrexate and Prednisone because she had two forms of cancer she beat (3 years ago bladder and breast). Patient was given Anastrozole (patient not sure) I am not taking that no more. Now, she had to have them to drain her knee, she got cortisone shot in her knee because knee was twice the size, now patient want to go back on methotrexate because she could not function because she was crippled with arthritis and was literally crippled right now. Patient wanted to know how long till she can take her Methotrexate again. Patient stated that her rheumatologist: ""he had senior citizens taking Methotrexate while they got a Pfizer shot, not good because I read another article saying that maybe a Pfizer shot would not work now because they were on Methotrexate, somebody has to wake up because we have problems nobody pay attention, and she pay attention to everything. She was very sick when she got covid and stated that at 4 'clock in the morning she took a Tramadol, and stated ""Tramadol was just a strong aspirin"". Patient had reaction to the first shot as had a sore (stated ""glands"" unable to clarify as she continued to talk) for a couple of hours and her second shot that she got yesterday no reaction at all to it. Patient stated she was in pain and had rheumatoid in arm and cannot hold arm now and she can hardly walk because of osteo in knees and she needed to be back on her medication as soon as she can because she was crippled. Patient was in the hospital in February and March, then in rehab for 10 days and was hospitalized for Covid 19 prior to being vaccinated. She takes prednisone and she has antibodies and stated she was fine.  The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  She has a menthol allergy she stays away from it now. The patient's mom was allergic to penicillin. The patient had and asthma attack from Vick's vapor rub. She mentioned she has allergies, so when she started sneezing and having runny nose initially she didn't think anything of it. She had measles shots when she was a child and the measles shots they gave her were no good, they found out the measles shots she got were no good; but she never caught measles or mumps and only had 2 pock marks from chickenpox. The only sickness she ever had was bladder cancer from smoking and she quit smoking 5 years ago; she had double negative breast cancer because her body didn't get rid of the estrogen so she had a lumpectomy. As of 14Dec2021, patient reported that she was diagnosed with covid 19 in Feb2020, got vaccinated May2021 and Jun2021 with Pfizer covid vaccine. Yesterday (13Dec2021) she tested positive for covid. She takes Prednisone and Methotrexate and received monoclonal antibodies today. She has a different strain of covid and that's why it messed up her breathing. She got the first and second dose of the covid 19 vaccine in May2021 and Jun2021 and got positive with covid and right now the caller has tested positive. She has pneumonia the second time and was taking antibiotics. The patient clarified and confirmed that the first time she ever got covid was in Feb2020 and she almost died. She got the covid vaccines 27May2021 and 27Jun2021. The patient's doctor said she should wait until February to get the booster dose. Now the patient got tested and was positive for covid. She was taking Methotrexate and Prednisone 2.5 mg and was waiting for her doctor to call her back because she was told if she gets any covid at all to stop taking the Methotrexate. The patient didn't stop taking her Methotrexate when she got the vaccine. She would have never known she had covid and she felt a little tired but that it. She went to the hospital to get tested for covid and was in there for 12 hours. Everyone around had the flu and was so sick, patient had not had a flu vaccine this year. The patient got the Monochronal antibody infusion the first time she had covid but it was too late. She has a pulmonary doctor, PCP, and an Infectious Disease doctor from the last time she had covid. She had pneumonia in her lung last time she had covid. She had the covid 3 of 4 days ago. About a week ago, she had a runny nose and was sneezing and she thought that was really weird and it was part of the covid. Patient asked what would have happened if she got the booster and didn't know she was going have the covid. After the first dose she was sore and then had no reaction with the second shot. Because she had a reaction with the first shot it showed it was working. So she didn't know if the vaccine wore off or what. The patient ended up in the hospital with covid when she wasn't vaccinated. She had male nurse and would throw her oxygen on the floor and told him: if you can't breathe in your sleep you'll wake up. They couldn't get the caller's blood pressure when she was in the hospital. She has bladder cancer and breast cancer and they had no problem giving her an IV when she the infusion. She didn't have cancer veins because she has a port.  She was in a rehab last year (2020) because she had drop foot. She had osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis from the cancer treatment (unspecified). If the Methotrexate keeps giving the covid she didn't want to take it anymore. She got the Monoclonal antibodies but it was too late because she already had pneumonia. The first time the patient had covid she was in the hospital for over a month then went to a rehab. This time the patient went to the emergency room to get the rapid test and another type of test. The patient was tested for cornonavirus and the covid 2 antigen swab and was diagnosed with covid. The patient has not slept for 24 hours and should be delirious and hasn't eaten either (Dec2021). She got the monoclonal antibodies today. She didn't have pneumonia right now. Last time, she  got double pneumonia so the shot may have prevented her from getting pneumonia this time. The events required emergency room visit.  She got tested positive with the new Omicron variant of COVID (13Dec2021). She was currently taking methotrexate because she was immunocompromised and a medication for rheumatoid arthritis. She felt slightly tired but just flu like symptoms she mentioned, but not too much. She was diagnosed with COVID omicron variant on 13Dec2021. She clarified that she did not have any questions, she knew that now she has to wait 90 days after she was administered the monoclonal infusion on 14Dec2021 to get the booster shot of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. She was diagnosed with COVID omicron variant on 13Dec2021: Onset date is unknown; initially provided as 4 days prior to diagnosis, which would have been 09Dec2021, but then she reported it could have been earlier than that, she does not know date of onset of symptoms. She was diagnosed in emergency room where she went on 13Feb2021 but couldn't be get the monoclonal infusion until 12 hours later on 14Feb2021 at 10:00. She never knew that she had the COVID omicron variant until diagnosed. She just had sneezing spells, like sneezing 15-20 times in a row, slight runny nose, and a little tired-but with Rheumatoid Arthritis she has that-tired. She had no fever, no loss of taste or smell and had no respiratory or breathing problems. She had no nausea. She is lactose intolerant and she ate cheesecake so she does not know if the cramping and sore bowels with diarrhea was from the cheesecake or it could have been a sign of COVID omicron variant, she was not sure, but those symptoms disappeared. She caught COVID omicron variant from her daughter's child who she babysits. Caller's daughter, daughter's child and daughter's husband all caught COVID omicron variant and got sick, daughter's husband got real sick. If her primary care doctor had listened to her and let her get the booster shot early then she did not think she would have gotten COVID omicron variant; but he told her she was supposed to wait 6-9 months after second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine to get the booster shot of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. She thinks the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine doses she was administered saved her. Regarding outcome of event patient reported she has had no symptoms since 3 days ago. In response to diagnosis of COVID omicron variant she was administered monoclonal infusion at 10:00 on 14Dec2021. Now she has to wait 90 days to get the booster shot of Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine. She was reading a report saying people that have a second breakthrough after the second shot in the end those are the ones who will become totally immune to the COVID. So she will probably become one of those people.  She mentioned she knew other people who had the other shot and one had triple bypass, another had diabetes, but they got the other shot, the Moderna shot, not Pfizer or Johnson; and they did not catch COVID omicron variant so the shots must be doing something. She does not know if they got their Moderna shots before or after her, and she declined to complete reports for those patients.

I subsequently noticed hives covering my entire lower abdomen and part of my lower back. I took a Benadryl 25mg pill and the rash/hives subsided within the hour. Later that evening, the rash and hives were back on my neck, back, and stomach and had spread to my shoulders and legs. I saw my allergist (whom I see not for allergies, but for asthma) the next day and they had me start taking Zyrtec.   The hives and rashes progressively got worse throughout the week to the point that my husband had to call EMS to our home on 11/26/21 when the hives had spread to my face and I experienced tongue swelling and throat closing (anaphylactic symptoms). My allergist started me on a 5 day prednisone course the next night as well as Allegra 180mg in the morning and at night with a Zyrtec mid-day. the prednisone helped mitigate (not completely but mostly) the hives for approximately 7 days (5 days on the medication and then 48 hours afterward), but they promptly came back after completion of the steroids.  My period was also 12 days late during the onset of this issue, which is never is. It now appears to be back on track a month later.",,,Y,,,,,,N,11/07/2021,11/22/2021,15,"During this time, my allergist had me do a litany of blood tests including: peanut, soybean, milk, eggs, corn, tree nuts, seafood, shellfish, chocolate, coconut, sunflowers, and chickpeas (all of which were negative) to rule out allergies. My thyroid was also checked and proved to be normal. Several autoimmune markers were checked (including those for Lupus and RA), with all being negative. I took a COVID test and was negative. I also am not pregnant. My allergist also checked my number of COVID antibodies from the vaccine and that number proved to be higher than what the lab can test for (>2500) and believes that the Moderna booster shot is causing an inappropriate immune response resulting in chronic dermatographia, hives, and rash all over my body.
